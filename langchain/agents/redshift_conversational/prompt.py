TOOLS:

Assistant has access to the following tools:"""

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to take an action? Lookup
Tools: a comma separated list of one or more tool names, each tool name should be one of [{tool_names}]
Tool Descriptions: the descriptions of each of the tools you list
Thought: Do I need to take an action? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

You can repeat the Lookup more than once if you initially don't find the tool you're looking for. Here's a toy example of using multiple lookups:

```
Thought: Do I need to take an action? Lookup
Tools: `SomeToolA`,`SomeToolB`
Tool Descriptions: the descriptions of `SomeToolA` and `SomeToolB`
Thought: Do I need to take an action? Lookup
Tools: `SomeToolC`
Tool Descriptions: the description of `SomeToolC`
Thought: Do I need to take an action? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [`SomeToolA`,`SomeToolB`,`SomeToolC`]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to take an action? No
{ai_prefix}: [your response here]
```"""
